# TITLE :Credit Card Fraud Detection — ML Project
# Objective
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on customer transaction data (amount, time, and anonymized features).
# Model Used
Algorithm: Random Forest / XGBoost (you can choose one)
Technique: Supervised Learning (Classification)
Problem Type: Binary Classification (Fraud = 1, Not Fraud = 0)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
#Dataset
Use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
# Features:
Time — Time elapsed between transactions
Amount — Transaction amount
V1–V28 — PCA-transformed features
Class — Target (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud)
#Model Performance
Accuracy: ~99%
Recall: High for fraud detection (important for real-world use)
# Conclusion
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project effectively demonstrates how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent transactions within large-scale financial data. By applying techniques like data preprocessing, feature scaling, and using models such as the Random Forest Classifier, we achieved a high level of accuracy and recall — crucial for detecting fraud cases that are often rare and highly imbalanced.
